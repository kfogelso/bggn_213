# Import countData and colData

Data used in this tutorial is from Himes et al., 2014
```{r}
counts <- read.csv("./airway_scaledcounts.csv", row.names = 1)
mdat <- read.csv("./airway_metadata.csv")
```

> Q1. How many genes are in this dataset?

38,694

> Q2. How many ‘control’ cell lines do we have?

4

```{r}
# Investigate the number of genes in the counts df
dim(counts)

# Investigate how many control cell lines we have in mdat
length(grep(pattern= "control", x=mdat$dex))

```
# Check the correspondence of the metadata and the count data 
```{r}
# Do the sample id names in metadata match the column names in the counts table?
# 'all' function checks if all values of logical test are TRUE

all(mdat$id == colnames(counts)) 

```
# Calculate mean count per gene for control and treated samples

```{r}
# Subset control & treated samples 
control <- subset(mdat, dex=="control")
treated <- subset(mdat, dex=="treated")
# control <- metadata[metadata[,"dex"]=="control",] alternative way to subset control samples 

# Subset counts for controls from counts df
control.counts <- counts[, control$id]
treated.counts <- counts[, treated$id]

```

# Find mean counts per gene for control and treated samples 
```{r}
# Mean control counts 
control.mean <- rowMeans(control.counts)
treated.mean <- rowMeans(treated.counts)

```
> Q3. How would you make the above code in either approach more robust?

I have implemented this in my code above. Instead of using 'rowSums(control.counts)/4' you can use rowMeans(control.counts) OR rowSums(control.counts)/length(control.counts). This makes the code more robust for future use if the number of control or treated samples changes. 

> Q4. Follow the same procedure for the treated samples (i.e. calculate the mean per gene across drug treated samples and assign to a labeled vector called treated.mean)

see above code. 

# Compare the control and treated samples 

>Q5 (a). Create a scatter plot showing the mean of the treated samples against the mean of the control samples. 

see below

>(b).You could also use the ggplot2 package to make this figure producing the plot below. What geom_?() function would you use for this plot?

geom_point (see below)

```{r}
# Combine control and treated means
meancounts <- data.frame(control.mean, treated.mean)

# Graph
ggplot(meancounts, aes(control.mean, treated.mean)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x)+
  theme_classic()
```
# Log transform data and plot again, since the range of values for gene expression are quite large 

> Q6. Try plotting both axes on a log scale. What is the argument to plot() that allows you to do this?

log. Note, I am using ggplot instead of built in plot function. 

```{r}
# Graph
ggplot(log(meancounts), aes(control.mean, treated.mean)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x)+
  theme_classic()
```
# Add log2 transform values to the meancounts df

```{r}
meancounts$log2fc <- log2(meancounts$treated.mean/meancounts$control.mean)


# is.nan(meancounts[,'log2fc'])
# drop.na
```

```{r}
# Remove zero counts to prevent non numeric values in mean counts table 
zero.vals <- which(meancounts[,1:2]==0, arr.ind=TRUE)
to.rm <- unique(zero.vals[,1])
mycounts <- meancounts[-to.rm,]
head(mycounts)

```
>Q7. What is the purpose of the arr.ind argument in the which() function call above? Why would we then take the first column of the output and need to call the unique() function?

arr.ind=TRUE indicates positions where there is a zero value. These are the positions (numerically) we want to remove. Unique will remove duplicate rows. 

> How many genes are upregulated at the log2 fold-change threshold of +2 or greater? 

```{r}
sum(mycounts$log2fc > +2)

# Percentage 
round((sum(mycounts$log2fc > +2)/nrow(mycounts))*100, 2)
```
>Q8. Using the up.ind vector above can you determine how many up regulated genes we have at the greater than 2 fc level? 

```{r}
sum(mycounts$log2fc > +2)
```

>Q9. Using the down.ind vector above can you determine how many down regulated genes we have at the greater than 2 fc level? 

```{r}
sum(mycounts$log2fc < -2)
```

>Q10. Do you trust these results? Why or why not?

No, because up until this point we have not done any tests for significance of the up & down regulated genes. 

# DESeq2 analysis 
```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, 
                              colData=mdat, 
                              design=~dex)

# Run analysis pipeline
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```
# Look at Deseq2 results

```{r}
res <- results(dds)
head(res)

# Look at summary of results
summary(res)
```
# Visualize results in volcano plot

```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, res$padj)
```
```{r}
# Log transformed data
plot(res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj))
abline(v=c(-2, 2), col="red")
abline(h=-log(0.05), col="gray")
```
# Adding annotation data 

Want to add gene names to our dataset to make sense of what is going on. To accomplish we will use bioconductor packages. 
```{r}
# Load/install neccessary packages for annotation 
library("AnnotationDbi")
#BiocManager::install("org.Hs.eg.db")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

# Map symbol, the common gene name, to each ENSEMBL gene id
res$symbol <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=row.names(res), # Our genenames
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",        # The format of our genenames
                     column="SYMBOL",          # The new format we want to add
                     multiVals="first")
head(res$symbol)
```
# Write results to file 
```{r}
# Write results to csv
write.csv(res, file="./all my results.csv")
```

# Pathway analysis 

Add kegg pathway analysis details to our results table 

```{r}
# Check annotation types 
columns(org.Hs.eg.db)

# Before we can use KEGG, we need to get gene identifiers in the correct format for KEGG, which is ENTREZ format in this case

res$entrez <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, # Annotation package
                     keys=row.names(res), # Our genenames
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",        # The format of our genenames
                     column="ENTREZID",          # The new format we want to add
                     multiVals="first")

res$genenames <-mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, # Annotation package
                     keys=row.names(res), # Our genenames
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",        # The format of our genenames
                     column="GENENAME",          # The new format we want to add
                     multiVals="first")

```
```{r}
# Find enriched pathways using gauge

# Create vector of fold changes w/ names of the values as ENTREZ IDs, which is required for gauge input

foldchanges <- res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) <- res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```
# Run gauge pathway analysis

```{r}
library(pathview)
library(gage)
library(gageData)
data(kegg.sets.hs)

keggres <- gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)

attributes(keggres)
```
# Pathview

The pathview() function will add our genes to a KEGG pathway as colored entries. 
```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa05310")
```
![](hsa05310.pathview.png)
